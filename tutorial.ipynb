    "- XAI-Guided-CoT is automated pipeline for Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting. In CoT, there two key types, first one in which no examples are given and second one in which few examples. We focus on the second type. In few-shot CoT, every example includes some data or information, the expected output and a reasoning. This reasoning explains how to get the expected output given the information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In context of a tabular binary classification task, the data refers to a row of data and expected output is the class label. For human, it is very time-consuming to write this reasoning and at times, the patterns are so complex that a human cannot articulate the reasoning in words. Therefore, we design a pipeline where this reasoning can be generated automatically by an LLM from explainability attributes such as feature importances and SHAP values.\n",

    "- In the workflow, a tree-based explainable model is trained and tuned. All the data splits and predictions are recorded for future evaluation. After training and tuning, the explainability attributes are computed: feature importances and SHAP. The SHAP CSV file is clustered to get diverse decision-making examples. The reasoning is generated for these diverse examples and they used as the reasoning component in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting.\n",

    "**Problem: Wandb sweep creation failures**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Symptoms**: Errors when creating wandb sweep\n",
    "- **Solution**:\n",
    "  - Verify `WANDB_API_KEY` and `WANDB_PROJECT_NAME` are set in `.env`\n",

    "\n",
    "**Check intermediate outputs:**\n",
    "- Inspect JSONL files in `data/batches/` and `data/batch_outputs/`\n",
    "- Verify batch files are properly formatted\n",
    "- Check for malformed JSON or missing fields\n",
    "\n",
    "**Verify component initialization:**\n",
    "- Test individual components separately before running full pipeline\n",
    "- Use `masked=True` in `pipeline.run()` to skip model training if debugging other components\n",
    "- Check component attributes after initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Monitor batch job status:**\n",
    "- Check GCP Console for Vertex AI batch job status\n",
    "- Monitor Together AI dashboard for batch job progress\n",
    "- Check Anthropic API for batch processing status\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common fixes:**\n",
    "- Restart Python kernel after changing `.env` file\n",
    "- Re-authenticate with `gcloud auth application-default login`\n",
    "- Clear cached files and re-run preprocessing\n",
    "- Verify all directory paths exist before running pipeline\n",
    "- Run unit tests (`pytest -v`) after customizing code\n",
